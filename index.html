        <h1>My Entrepreneurial Journey</h1>
        <p>
            This personal website documents my entrepreneurial journey as part of the ENT 110 course.
            It highlights the problem I identified, the solution I developed, and the process of building
            and testing a prototype. This website serves as an ongoing academic portfolio of my work.
        </p>

    <!-- Problem -->
    <section id="problem" class="section fade-in">
        <h2>Problem Identification</h2>
        <p>
            Low health literacy causes many patients aged 18–65 attending urban community clinics
            to incorrectly follow newly prescribed medication instructions, especially within the
            first 60 days of prescription.
        </p>
        <p>
            Complex, text-heavy, and culturally non-specific patient education materials make it
            difficult for patients to understand medication usage, dosage, and side effects.
            This leads to medication errors, avoidable complications, poor health outcomes,
            and preventable hospital readmissions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Solution -->
    <section id="solution" class="section light fade-in">
        <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p>
            The proposed solution is a patient-centered medication education platform designed
            to improve understanding and adherence. It uses simple language, visual icons,
            short explainer videos, and optional audio narration to communicate medication
            instructions clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patients access the information through QR codes provided at clinics or on mobile
            devices, making the solution accessible, culturally adaptable, and easy to use for
            individuals with varying literacy levels.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Prototype -->
    <section id="prototype" class="section fade-in">
        <h2>Prototype Development</h2>
        <p>
            As part of the venture creation process, I developed a low-fidelity prototype to
            demonstrate how the solution would work in practice. The prototype focuses on
            usability, clarity, and accessibility rather than full technical development.
        </p>
        <p>
            It includes visual medication instructions, simplified dosage guidance, and
            multimedia explanations. User feedback was considered to identify areas for
            improvement and future iteration.
        </p>

    <!-- Journey -->
    <section id="journey" class="section light fade-in">
        <h2>Entrepreneurial Journey & Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            This project documents my journey through the venture creation process, including
            problem identification, root cause analysis, research, ideation, solution design,
            lean canvas development, prototyping, and reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through this experience, I learned the importance of empathy, research-driven
            decision-making, and iterative design in entrepreneurship. The project strengthened
            my ability to identify real-world problems and develop practical, user-centered solutions.
